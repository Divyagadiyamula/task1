    <p>Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" <br>often refers to geology and wildlife. 
       Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes 
       associated with inanimate objects—the <br>way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, 
       such as the weather and geology of the Earth.
